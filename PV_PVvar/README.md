## Progress variable and progress variable variance
This solver can handle tables with only the (unscaled) progress variable and its variance. The progress variable and its variance is scaled in accordance with the minimum and maximum value of the progress variable in the flamelet. This is currently hardcoded in solver/src/combustionModel/FGM/baseFGM/baseFGM.C. Therefore, this solver can only handle mixtures with an equivalence ratio of 0.3
